He didn't like tea parties, and<br> neither do you. Upbeat and always looking for some<br> fun to have with others, you're really much like him. Bluey never takes breaks unless he's asleep all<br> snuggled up in a kid's arms and you may not even have heard of sleep. By now you two must have created your very own 2-minute long custom greeting involving high fiving, fist bumping and breakdancing at the same time. All the love to your endless energy container.</div>
